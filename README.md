This is a French version of Hangman (Pendu).

The goal was to write and test how easy (or hard:) it is to make this game in CoffeeScript.

The original version was in Tcl/Tk. I use that game to test other out of ordinary programming languages that
have a decent but not too complex graphical toolkit. 
So I rewrote the game from the ground up in Lazarus (freePascal), Groovy, Beanshell and CoffeeScript.
The main goal is to test a language that is as multi-platform as it can be.
